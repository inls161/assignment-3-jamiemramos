# WELCOME TO THE MARKDOWN FILE!

This will be written about markdown, IN markdown!

Isn't this all __*exciting*__!?

That _*excitement*_ was both bolded and italicized! You use asterisks and underscores to make those!

## LET'S MAKE A LIST, YA'LL.
###This one is going to be ordered!
1. Markdown is fun!
2. Markdown is cool!
3. Markdown is easy!

An ordered list is made by adding the numbers before each entry!

### This one is not going to be ordered!
* Isn't markdown great?
* Do you like markdown?
* Is there anything you don't understand about markdown?

An unordered list is made by adding asterisks or dashes before each entry!

### Next we're going to make a table!

left  middle        right
----  ------------  ------------
0     zero          cero
1     one           uno
2     two           dos
3     three         tres
4     four          cuatro
5     five          cinco
6     six           seis
7     seven         siete
8     eight         eight
9     nine          nueve


Here's code formatting! You add backticks!


`this.aWord`

"Checkout how markdown knows just how'ta format quotes--and dashes! It's so `smart`!"

Smart quotes in pandoc are done by adding the smart `-S` command!

Markdown supports 6 headers!

# This is heading one!
## This is heading two!
### This is heading three!
#### This is heading four!
##### This is heading five!
###### This is heading six!

Markdown supports 6 headers!

Headers are done by adding hashtags!

##LET'S DO MATH!
(No real math included, just some ridiculous complicated stuff I made in markdown!)

`$$ \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{14}{y}}{x-z} $$` makes: 

$$ \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{14}{y}}{x-z} $$

`$$ \sqrt[x]{1+x+y+134+x^7+x^6+\dots+x^z} $$` makes:

$$ \sqrt[x]{1+x+y+134+x^7+x^6+\dots+x^z} $$

`$$ \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{14}{y}}{x-z}\sqrt[x]{1+x+y+134+x^7+x^6+\dots+x^z} $$` makes:

$$ \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{14}{y}}{x-z}\sqrt[x]{1+x+y+134+x^7+x^6+\dots+x^z} $$
